# Code 5
sentence = "I just came to say hello!"
for c in sentence:
	print(c)

#  â€¢	Expected Output: This code will produce the same output as Code 4,
#  printing each character of the sentence on a new line. The loop iterates
#  directly over the string, which is equivalent to using range(len(sentence)).
